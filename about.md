Hi there ğŸ‘‹!

I'm a seasoned software programmer working now in backend development. I started to code when I was a teenager and have been programming ever since. My journey has taken me through various languages, from BASIC ğŸ¤– to Scala ğŸš— passing thought Java.
In my free time, I enjoy reading ğŸ“– science fiction books (mainly Isaac Asimov and other classic authors like Arthur C. Clarke, Robert A. Heinlein, etc...). I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.
