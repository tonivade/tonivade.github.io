Here it is a list of my sike projects I was working on lately. I will keep updating this list as I keep working on new projects:

* RespServer [GitHub](https://github.com/tonivade/resp-server) A RESP server implementation in Java.
* ClauDB [GitHub](https://github.com/tonivade/claudb) A redis implemantation in Java that uses RespServer as the protocol server and [h2-mvstore](https://www.h2database.com/html/mvstore.html) as the storage engine. Useful for integration tests.
* Purefun [GitHub](https://github.com/tonivade/purefun) A functional programming library for Java. Not intended to be used in production, but rather as a playground for functional programming concepts in Java.
* ZeroMock [GitHub](https://github.com/tonivade/zeromock) A mocking library for Java designed to be simple and easy to use.
* pq [GitHub](https://github.com/tonivade/pq) A parquet command line tool for Java. It allows you to read and write parquet files from the command line.
* Minimal Json [GitHub](https://github.com/tonivade/minimal-json) A fork of the original minimal-json library with some improvements and bug fixes. It is a lightweight JSON parser for Java.
* Make a Lisp [GitHub](https://github.com/tonivade/mal) A Java 25 implementation of the "Make a Lisp" project, which is a simple Lisp interpreter written in Java. It is a great way to learn about interpreters and programming languages.
* Diesel [GitHub](https://github.com/tonivade/diesel) A functional programming library for Java that allows you to create DSLs and combine them. It is designed to be simple and easy to use for Java developers. It's inspired in some scala libraries like cats-effect and ZIO.
